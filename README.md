Parallel-computing-for-nesting-loops-in-R-
==========================================
R is widely used around the world by researchers. I am working on my master's thesis and using R to do simulation. I found that it took 3 days to run 50 times simulations using my code. I am tired of waiting several days until getting my updated results which still need improvment. I was trying to embed parallel computing in the code.
